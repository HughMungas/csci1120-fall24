## Instructions
In _Chapter 10_, the `class clockType` was designed to implement the time of day in a program. Certain applications, in addition to hours, minutes, and seconds, might require you to store the time zone. Derive the `class extClockType` from the `class clockType` by adding a member variable to store the time zone called `timeZone`. Add the necessary member functions and constructors to make the class functional. Also, write the definitions of the member functions and the constructors. Finally, write a test program to test your class.
